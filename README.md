## The Problem? 
Australia doesn’t have a centralised place that consumers can purchase shoes. Currently, if you’re looking for a specific shoe, you would have to research various sites such as the site's website, eBay, Gumtree, Facebook etc. This takes a lot of time and effort having to compare and continually visit these websites until you’re able to find the particular product or have it at a certain price. 

## The Solution? 
I decided to create a two-sided market place for buying, selling and trading shoes at one easy convenient location. The website would have a database of all the shoes created where users can search for a specific shoe and see if a retailer or another user is selling it. If neither are available, they are also able to post requests up to see if anyone is able to help. The website would offer a wide variety of different outlets for the user to purchase their perfect shoe.
