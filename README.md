## The Problem? 
Australia doesn’t have a centralised place that consumers can purchase shoes. Currently, if you’re looking for a specific shoe, you would have to research various sites such as the site's website, eBay, Gumtree, Facebook etc. This takes a lot of time and effort having to compare and continually visit these websites until you’re able to find the particular product or have it at a certain price.

## The Solution? 
I decided to create a two-sided marketplace for buying, selling and trading shoes at one secure, convenient location. The website would have a database of all the shoes created where users can search for a specific shoe and see if a retailer or another user is selling it. If neither are available, they are also able to post requests up to see if anyone can help. The website would offer a wide variety of different outlets for the user to purchase their perfect shoe.  

## Design Process

I wanted my designs to be simple and elegant where the primary focus would be the products. Most of the designs on my inspiration board were very simple with only three or four colours. They all have big hero images to showcase the products which is what I am also aiming to do.

My wireframes are very simple with not much content in them. As a said earlier, I wanted a simple and elegant design where the main content would be the photos of the shoes which I think is the most important.

#### Challenges 

I face a lot of problems building this application up from scratch. Here are some
* Naming conventions are taken for granted when you’re making a small application but when you begin making one this large, you soon realise that naming things is a massive battle
* I took the ERD for granted and didn’t think it was essential. Its very important
* Rushing my code and then migrating my models and then making a typo and not double checking the migration file. Many migrations because of adding, removing and changing columns to ridiculous. 
* Understanding the MVC but this project helped immensely 
* Routing
* The CSS was difficult even though I barely did any. Decided on using a lot of Bootstrap instead. 
There were so many challenges throughout the project. 

### Favorite parts

* I thoroughly enjoyed the design part of the project in Figma and finding inspiration (I didn’t get to put all aspects of them in the project). 
* Implementing a feature and having so many errors is so daunting. But the feeling that you receive when you're able to fix them and see what you’ve made come to life is fantastic. 

There were also expansion plans that I had thought of if the application had taken off. 
* Consignment is the function of when a store takes a product from a user and then sells it for them for a price. Then the assignee would receive a cut from the profits (e.g. 10%) of the selling price. This would remove the fuss from users having to sell their products and still receive a fair amount for their products
* Authentication service where the store would have a verified way to check whether the product was legitimate. In many situations, users spend hundreds on shoes and they would like the reassurance that the product they’re buying is real. 
* Having a social media connection where users were able to showcase the shoe they were wearing to give others inspiration for what they would purchase next
* Having shoe related business connected to the website where users could compare prices of all their stock. For example, it would show the cost of a pair of particular shoes from Platypus,  HYPE and the original retailer and help the user get the best possible deal. 

I understand that this was an MVP and in the short time that we were given, all these features would have been too ambitious for the skill level that I currently possess.
